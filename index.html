In 2017 the entire 10.8 acres were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/news/the-open-space-institute-scenic-hudson-donate-land-for-new-philipstown-park">donated to the Town of Philipstown by OSI and Scenic Hudson</a>. Framed by trails to Sugarloaf and Castle Rock, its uncultivated but loamy earth is bathed in full sun from April to harvest.</p><p>Proposed for town-wide community gardens, this uncommon pasture combines agricultural elements rarely found together on the same site. Quenched by an abundant artesian spring and the Arden Brook to the east, the site has all the prerequisites for thriving habitat, productive, varied and successful community agriculture. </p></div></div></div><div class="Homepage-column-0-2-7"><a class="Thumbnail-container-0-2-26" href="/images/redboxSurvey.jpg" target="_blank"><h2>Location in Garrison</h2><img src="/images/redboxSurvey.jpg" class="Thumbnail-img-0-2-27"/></a></div></div><div class="Homepage-columns-0-2-6"><div class="Homepage-column-0-2-7"><div class="Info-container-0-2-16 "><h2 class="Info-header-0-2-18">Our Vision</h2><div class="Info-bodyText-0-2-23 "><p>New Leaf Restoration, Inc. is a limited liability company formed in 2020, with pending 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. The current working committee, which will form the Board of Directors upon nonprofit status approval, is comprised of seven members. An Advisory Council, with members from different sectors and areas of expertise in the Philipstown community, is also being formed.</p><p>Upon nonprofit status approval, New Leaf Restoration, Inc., with input from the Philipstown community and the Advisory Council, will develop a plan to implement and install various types of gardens on the site. Some of the ideas currently being considered include, but are not limited to: perennials, pollinator-friendly plants, a teen garden, community berry garden and individual produce gardens, the last of which would be offered to Philipstown residents for individual usage.</p><p>Charter partnerships include the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Putnam County, Stonecrop Gardens, and the Putnam Highlands Audubon Society.</p></div></div><div class="Info-container-0-2-16 "><div class="Info-bodyText-0-2-23 "><div class="Affiliates-logosWrap-0-2-28"><a href="http://putnam.cce.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" class="Affiliates-logoItemLink-0-2-29"><img src="/images/cornell.jpg" class="Affiliates-logoItemImage-0-2-30"/></a><a href="https://www.putnamhighlandsaudubon.org/" target="_blank" class="Affiliates-logoItemLink-0-2-29"><img src="/images/audubon.gif" class="Affiliates-logoItemImage-0-2-30"/></a><a href="https://butterfieldlibrary.org/" target="_blank" class="Affiliates-logoItemLink-0-2-29"><img src="/images/butterfield.png" class="Affiliates-logoItemImage-0-2-30"/></a><a href="https://desmond-fish-library.square.site/" target="_blank" class="Affiliates-logoItemLink-0-2-29"><img src="/images/desmondfish.jpg" class="Affiliates-logoItemImage-0-2-30"/></a></div></div></div><div class="Info-container-0-2-16 "><h2 class="Info-header-0-2-18">Garden Aspects</h2><div class="Info-bodyText-0-2-23 "><ul><li>Perennial exchange garden and meandering walk along the brook</li><li>Netted community berry garden</li><li>Modular individual plot gardens for produce</li><li>Separate teen garden</li><li>Youth Habitat Education program</li><li>Educational programming including beekeeping, pollinators, birding, etc.</li><li>Irrigation plan; a light-footprint from the artesian spring reducing the need for individual watering trips to the garden.</li></ul></div></div><div class="Info-container-0-2-16 "><h2 class="Info-header-0-2-18">Invasive Species – Eradication</h2><div class="Info-bodyText-0-2-23 "><p>The pasture has substantial invasive species including multiflora rose, black swallow wort, and others.
