Lewis Kingsley is a naturalist in the spirit of John Muir. Lew, along with a small original group in the ‘70’s and ‘80’s helped to galvanize the environmental movement in the Hudson Highlands and forever changed the trajectory of her forests, habitats and waterways.  He is one of the founding members of the Putnam Highlands Audubon Society and current board member. Lew is a founding member of and serves on the board of the Hudson Highlands Land Trust as well as the Town of Philipstown Conservation Committee (Wetlands). Lew is a founding board member of Riverkeeper and Constitution Marsh and has provided advice in various capacities for six decades to the following organizations: Constitution Marsh, Clearwater, Scenic Hudson, Riverkeeper, Black Rock Forest, Hudson Highlands Trail Conference, New York State DEC, New York State Parks Department. Blessed for 30 years with the love of Rita Jo Riehle until 2018, Lew is a retired certified arborist and an early member of the International Society of Arboriculture. Lew retired from the business that bears his name and today son Ian owns Kingsley Tree while son Forrest owns Rita’s former business, RJR Horticulturist. Scientific proof that the apples didn’t fall far from the tree.</p><p>Tim has been involved with  initiatives that support an active, healthy and positive culture in Philipstown and the Hudson Valley. Currently he serves on the board of the Putnam History Museum and the Friends of Mine Dock Park, Inc., is a member of the West Point-Highland Falls Rotary and founded the South Redoubt Reclamation initiative to preserve the Revolutionary fortification. Along with David Gordon Tim wrote and produced a documentary on the Garrison Commons “Harvesting a Diamond”. Tim served on the Town of Philipstown Wetlands Committee, founded P.L.A.Y, Philipstown Lacrosse Association for Youth, was a director and referee in C.Y.O. and recently guessed that he coached well over a thousand young people. With his wife and avid gardener Cathleen they moved to Garrison in 1986 and raised their four children. Today they enjoy being a positive influence in the lives of their children, five grandchildren, friends, family, parish and community. Tim works in technical sales with industrial generators.</p><p><strong>Ann Borthwick</strong> has lived in Philipstown for almost 20 years.
