Restoration Garden. Please read carefully the following information and rules, which have been designed to ensure that the garden is a safe, pleasant, and inviting place. Thank you!\n\n1. Plot lease is limited to one per household and members must be Philipstown residents for this initial offering.\n\n1. Garden plots are 10’ x 4.’ Cost for the 2021 season is $100 per plot.\n\n1. The garden is open from dawn to dusk, seven days a week, from date on which the garden opens for the season (TBD) through to Thanksgiving.\n\n1. Water and soaker hoses will be provided and set up for each plot with timers. Watering cans for watering seeds and plants at the time of planting will be provided at the communal spigot.\n\n1. The use of pesticides will be limited to supplied organic products only.\n\n1. Tools will not be provided; gardeners are responsible for supplying their own tools.\n\n1. Please do not leave tools, bags, garbage, etc., in or around your plot when you leave; take all items with you when you leave the garden.\n\n1. Please be respectful of other members’ plots. Always use pathways. Do not step into members’ plots.\n\n1. Members should be mindful to avoid shading other members’ plots with tall or staked plants, i.e., sunflowers, pole beans, etc.\n\n1. Garden plots should be weeded and maintained throughout the season. If you are unable to care for your plot for the entire season, please email a notification to info@newleaf-restoration.org so that your plot can be made available to another member.\n\n1. If you will be unable to tend to your plot for three weeks or more during the season, you may arrange for another member to care for your plot while you are away.\n\n1. Members will be issued a combination for the lock on the main garden entrance gate. This combination must not be shared with anyone. Combinations will be changed annually.\n\n1. Please close the gate after entering the garden and be sure it is locked when you leave the garden.\n\n1. Members should immediately report any theft, vandalism, or maintenance issues to info@newleaf-restoration.org.\n\n\nThe following rules are in place so that our garden is a pleasant place to garden, enjoy nature, and share knowledge—and one which provides a healthy community atmosphere. Your adherence to these rules will help ensure that all gardeners have an enjoyable and productive gardening season.\n\n1. The garden is open to members only, Friends and family may enter only when accompanied by a garden member.\n1. Children must be supervised in the garden at all times. Please do not allow children to run through the garden or damage other members’ plants.\n1. Pets are not permitted in the garden.\n1. No smoking, alcohol, or illegal substances are permitted in the garden.\n1. The application of herbicides is prohibited.\n1. Weedy plants, i.e., fennel, mints, etc. must not be planted.\n1. Only composted manure is permitted.\n1. No additional hoses will be allowed.\n1. Permanent structures are not permitted in garden plots.\n1. Do not harvest other gardeners’ fruits or vegetables without their permission.\n1. Gardeners are responsible for removing all plant material from their plots and disposing of it in the compost pile by no later than Thanksgiving. The exception to this expectation is members who are planting winter crops.\n\nAny gardener failing to abide by these rules will be sent up to two notices identifying the nature of the issue(s), along with a date by which the issue(s) should be resolved. If the gardener fails to correct said issue, they risk forfeiture of their plot(s), the loss of future gardening privileges at the community garden, and forfeiture of any fees paid.\n\n\n`;\n\nclass PurchaseScreen extends Component {\n  state = {};\n  handleInputChange = (event) => {\n    const target = event.target;\n    const value = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value;\n    this.setState({checked: value});\n  };\n  checkAvailable = async () => {\n    const isDev = window.location.search.includes('env=dev');\n    const env = isDev ?
