intro: {
header: 'The Site',
body: `In 1984 this verdant pasture, long a source of feed and water for livestock was protected for conservation by the Osborn family. In 2017 the entire 10.8 acres were [donated to the Town of Philipstown by OSI and Scenic Hudson](https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/news/the-open-space-institute-scenic-hudson-donate-land-for-new-philipstown-park). Framed by trails to Sugarloaf and Castle Rock, its uncultivated but loamy earth is bathed in full sun from April to harvest.

Proposed for town-wide community gardens, this uncommon pasture combines agricultural elements rarely found together on the same site. Quenched by an abundant artesian spring and the Arden Brook to the east, the site has all the prerequisites for thriving habitat, productive, varied and successful community agriculture. `,

steering: {
header: `Master Plan`,
body: `A local steering committee proposed to the Town Board to organize a restoration of this pasture into town-wide community gardens with various produce, ornamental and pollinator gardens.  A Master Plan was presented to the Town Board in Spring 2019.  **New Leaf**’s vision is an inter-generational site. Once restored the produce garden will offer an organic plot to each residence in Philipstown while enhancing our community.

The proposed Master Plan is a starting point, phased-in and not intended to be completed all at once. Listed below are the Garden Aspects. These are smaller, planned, team-based garden projects within the scope of the Master Plan.`
