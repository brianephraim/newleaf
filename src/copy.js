intro: {
body: `In 1984 this verdant pasture, long a source of feed and water for livestock was protected for conservation by the Osborn family. In 2017 the entire 10.8 acres were [donated to the Town of Philipstown by OSI and Scenic Hudson](https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/news/the-open-space-institute-scenic-hudson-donate-land-for-new-philipstown-park). Framed by trails to Sugarloaf and Castle Rock its abundant loamy earth is bathed in year-round sunlight.

Now proposed for Philipstown’s town-wide community gardens, this unique pasture combines agricultural elements rarely found together on the same site. Quenched by an artesian spring on the western edge and the Arden Brook in the eastern tree line, it has all the prerequisites for thriving habitat and creative, varied and successful community agriculture. `,

steering: {
body: `A New Leaf steering committee proposed to the Town Board to transition this pasture into town-wide intergenerational community gardens; produce, ornamental and pollinator gardens.  A first draft Master Plan was presented to the Town Board in Spring 2019. Aligning with New Leaf’s vision of an intergenerational site, our proposal is to guarantee an organic plot to every residence in Philipstown.

The proposed plan is a starting point, not intended to be completed all at once. Listed below are the Garden Aspects; planned, smaller team-based garden projects within the scope of the plan.`,
