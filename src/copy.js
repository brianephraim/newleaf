intro: {
header: 'The Site',
body: `In 1984 this verdant pasture, long a source of feed and water for livestock was protected for conservation by the Osborn family. In 2017 the entire 10.8 acres were [donated to the Town of Philipstown by OSI and Scenic Hudson](https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/news/the-open-space-institute-scenic-hudson-donate-land-for-new-philipstown-park). Framed by trails to Sugarloaf and Castle Rock, its uncultivated but loamy earth is bathed in full sun from April to harvest.

Proposed for town-wide community gardens, this uncommon pasture combines agricultural elements rarely found together on the same site. Quenched by an abundant artesian spring and the Arden Brook to the east, the site has all the prerequisites for thriving habitat, productive, varied and successful community agriculture. `,

steering: {
header: `Our Vision`,
body: `**New Leaf’s** steering group has proposed to organize a restoration of this pasture into town-wide flowering, intergenerational community gardens of native pollinator, perennial, berry and individual produce gardens. A proposed Master Plan was presented to the Town Board in Spring 2019. Once restored the produce gardens can offer an organic plot to each residence in Philipstown.

Starting small, the proposed phased-in Master Plan is team-based and to be completed over time. Listed here are modular **Garden Aspects** proposed for the pasture. These are planned, resident-led, team-based garden projects within the scope of a final approved Master Plan.`
