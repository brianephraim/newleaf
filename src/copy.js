intro: {
header: 'The Site',
body: `In 1984 this verdant pasture, long a source of feed and water for livestock was protected for conservation by the Osborn family. In 2017 the entire 10.8 acres were [donated to the Town of Philipstown by OSI and Scenic Hudson](https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/news/the-open-space-institute-scenic-hudson-donate-land-for-new-philipstown-park). Framed by trails to Sugarloaf and Castle Rock, its uncultivated but loamy earth is bathed in full sun from April to harvest.

Proposed for town-wide community gardens, this uncommon pasture combines agricultural elements rarely found together on the same site. Quenched by an abundant artesian spring and the Arden Brook to the east, the site has all the prerequisites for thriving habitat, productive, varied and successful community agriculture. `,

body: `New Leaf Restoration, Inc. is a limited liability company formed in 2020, with pending 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. The current working committee, which will form the Board of Directors upon nonprofit status approval, is comprised of seven members.

Upon nonprofit status approval, New Leaf Restoration, Inc., with input from the Philipstown community and the Advisory Council, will develop a plan to implement and install various types of gardens on the site. Some of the ideas currently being considered include, but are not limited to: perennials, pollinator-friendly plants, a teen garden, community berry garden and individual produce gardens, the last of which would be offered to Philipstown residents for individual usage.

Charter partnerships include the Cornell Cooperative Extension of Putnam County, Stonecrop Gardens, and the Putnam Highlands Audubon Society.`
