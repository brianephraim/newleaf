intro: {
header: 'The Site',
body: `In 1984 this verdant pasture, long a source of feed and water for livestock was protected for conservation by the Osborn family. In 2017 the entire 10.8 acres were [donated to the Town of Philipstown by OSI and Scenic Hudson](https://www.openspaceinstitute.org/news/the-open-space-institute-scenic-hudson-donate-land-for-new-philipstown-park). Framed by trails to Sugarloaf and Castle Rock, its uncultivated but loamy earth is bathed in full sun from April to harvest.

Proposed for town-wide community gardens, this uncommon pasture combines agricultural elements rarely found together on the same site. Quenched by an abundant artesian spring and the Arden Brook to the east, the site has all the prerequisites for thriving habitat, productive, varied and successful community agriculture. `,

body: `**Lew Kingsley**, **Tim Donovan** – co-founders${'  '}
When they met over 20 years ago, Lew told Tim that “if you teach my sons how to play lacrosse, I’ll try to teach you how to keep from killing yourself or cutting off your foot when you fell a tree.”

Without exaggeration, H. Lewis Kingsley is a naturalist in the spirit of John Muir. Lew, along with a small original group in the 1970s and 80s, helped to galvanize the environmental movement in the Hudson Highlands and forever changed the trajectory of its forests, habitats and waterways.  Lew is a founding member and current board member of the Putnam Highlands Audubon Society. He is also a founding member and current board member of the Hudson Highlands Land Trust, as well as the Town of Philipstown Conservation Committee (Wetlands). Lew is a founding board member of Riverkeeper and Constitution Marsh and has provided advice in various capacities for six decades to the following organizations: Constitution Marsh, Clearwater, Scenic Hudson, Riverkeeper, Black Rock Forest, Hudson Highlands Trail Conference, New York State DEC, New York State Parks Department. Blessed for 30 years with the love of the late Rita Jo Riehle until 2018, Lew is a retired certified arborist and an early member of the International Society of Arboriculture. Lew retired from the business that bears his name and today his son, Ian, owns Kingsley Tree while son Forrest owns Rita’s former business, RJR Horticulturist – scientific proof that the apples didn’t fall far from the tree.

Tim has been involved with local initiatives which support an active, healthy and positive culture in the Hudson Valley. He currently serves on the board of the Putnam History Museum, the Friends of Mine Dock Park, Inc. and is a member of the West Point-Highland Falls Rotary. Tim formed the South Redoubt Reclamation Team in the Garrison School Forest to preserve the Revolutionary War fortification footprint. Together with David Gordon they produced a documentary on the history of the Garrison Commons and its ballfield. He has served on the Town of Philipstown’s Wetlands Committee, the Economic Development Committee and he founded  P.L.A.Y, (Philipstown Lacrosse Association for Youth) where he enjoyed teaching the game and culture of lacrosse to local families for 20 years. Along with Cathleen, an avid gardener, they moved to Garrison in 1986 and raised their four children. Today they enjoy being a positive influence in the lives of their children, five grandchildren, their friends, family and community. Tim is a technical sales engineer for an industrial generator manufacturer.
